# Summary
### Analysis: it is not believed that positivity bias plays a maor role in the reviews the Vine program recieves. As seen in the screenshot above, the unpaid reviews had a greater perrcentage of five-star reviews compared to the paid reviews. I find it likely that people who are interested in *critiqueing* new products are likely very *critical* people.  
### Additional Analysis: using this dataset, I think an interesting analysis to run would take a closer look at the verified purchases column. I think that too much consideration for non-verified purchases may have skewed our numbers.
